This is me making a Blackjack game.  I don't know how into it I'll go. I may make it multiplayer,
use pygame down the road to add graphics.  While all my previous projects have been commandline 
projects it would be a step forward to make something that isn't that.

That said, this is just started, so it doesn't even function as a game yet.  I made the rookie mistake of not really think about how the game will operate so now I need to rip apart main() and start over.
